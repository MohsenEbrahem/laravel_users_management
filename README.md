# Laravel users management project

### this project foucuses on how to create users and how to give them roles and permissions
#### the packages that we used it
- installing [Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) package that enables you to provide your application with the routes, controllers, and views you need to register and authenticate your application's users
- installing [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v5/introduction) package that enables you to give the users roles and permissions.
#### [email verfication](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/verification) added to verify users email addresses before using the application and we had to use [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) as fake smtp sever to test, view and share emails sent from the pre-production environments and test with real data without the risk of spamming real customers.
